<!--
Badges: On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such
as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields
to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a
badge.
Visuals: Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include
screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos)
Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

<!-- Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and
add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A trrlist of Features
or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives
to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.  -->
## **Description**
This project is a tool for making a everyday video, which is timelapse video or slides video, of images but for face of a person, this if you take a picture of yourself everyday and you want to appreciate how you are getting old. In this readme file there're the instructions for running the dev-working environment and the 

<br />

## **Motivation**
I made this repo to explain some of my students the basic concepts of git in practice, removing, and modifying some parts of the code, making issues, and PR (pull request), also to show them some practices of coding, documentation, virtual environments, container, and dependencies for developments.

<br />

<!--
Installation: Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of
installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the
possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more
guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using
your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like
a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies
that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
Usage: Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's
helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate,
while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to
reasonably include in the README.
-->

## **Installation & Requirements**
A recommendation is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the main IDE for development. Make sure you also have installed in your host:
 1. [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
 2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 3. [Remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)[extension]
 4. [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) 

<br />

 <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## **Tutorials**
 
1. [Building and running the development-container](docs/dev_ws_seting_up.md) 
2. [Running every day studio](docs/running_studio.md) 
2. [Code structure and explanation](docs/code_explanation.md)

## **Drawbacks & Enhancements**

* **[ENHACEMENT]**: Add support to operate/modify the image (rotate, move, scale), and save/load this settings for every file, although auto-fit face is working really well.
* **[ENHACEMENT]**: the visuals and graphic user interface could be better.
* **[FEATURE]**: Remove somehow the background of the image and take only the person shape, body or face only.
* **[FEATURE]**: Add filters to the faces :)
* **[FEATURE]**: Key to remove/ignore file in the dataset
* **[MUST-DO]**: Keep aspect ratio when re-scaling images

If you think in more incredible ideas, create a issue with the correct label: issue, enhancement, bug, etc ...

<!-- State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for
accepting them.
 
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some
documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should
run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit.
These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
 
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help
to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes
inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is
especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium
server for testing in a browser.  -->
