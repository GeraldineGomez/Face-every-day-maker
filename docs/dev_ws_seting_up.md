# **Running The Dev-Container**
 
If you have your [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the right extensions, and if you have Docker and Docker-compose installed in your system, when you open the Project's main folder you'll see a window on the bottom right corner, click in "reopen in container" button, if you don't see anything press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in container` or `Docker-images: Build Image` option. When the container is opened, and executed for the first time or when there are changes on it, you can go for a walk because the building image process will start and it'll take a while due to the installation of all packages and dependencies of the dev-environment as [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and more stuff related to, while the process is completed here are some videos of [puppies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRf3-JkwqfU). You can see at any time the logs of the building process clicking in `Starting with Dev Container` on the bottom right corner. When the process is done you'll see some messages of process succeed.

When the process is done you can open a terminal in the dev-container going to the menu bar `Terminal` and then `New Terminal`. Congratulations now you have everything that I use for the deployments and development of this project.
 
Do not forget pull the repo's sub-modules (if there are) with:

      git submodule update --init
